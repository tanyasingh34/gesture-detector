# gesture-detector
An AI-driven real-time gesture detection system built with Python, OpenCV, MediaPipe, and PyAutoGUI. This project enables users to interact with their computers and web platforms (like YouTube, Google, Instagram, etc.) through hand gestures captured via webcam â€” making digital control contactless, intuitive, and accessible.
